# GEMEX

An example Rails app demonstrating extracting and gemifying lib code. The non-master branches present stages of the journey between in-app code and separate gem.

## Branches

- [lib_code](https://github.com/tdumitrescu/gemex/tree/lib_code): contains `OldYeller` code embedded within the Rails app under `lib/`
- [gemify](https://github.com/tdumitrescu/gemex/tree/gemify): `OldYeller` has been extracted to a gem located in the local filesystem
